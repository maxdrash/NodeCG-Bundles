# NodeCG-Bundles
These are some NodeCG bundles I made, that I use on my Twitch stream to show information.

This is mainly here for other people to reference, I hope I don't see anyone using these exact things on their streams. ;)

A couple of notes
- They use the tmi.js library, which you will need to install into your NodeCG installation yourself.
- They can sometimes reference files in each other's folders (to get around external program limitations).
